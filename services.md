I am open to hire for comissions or freelance! Here is what I can do.

# Software development

I have experience in developing:
1. Bots (Discord bot)
2. An API (experience with Rust, Python, NodeJS)
3. Mobile applications
4. Desktop applications

For a full list of projects take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/AlphabetsAlphabets). My CV is also available [here](https://github.com/AlphabetsAlphabets/alphabetsalphabets.github.io/blob/gh-pages/2025%20March%2020.pdf).

# Copywriter

I can write on a variety of content. Such as:
1. Technology - As someone who maintains a tech blog, I will always do my best to convey technical information so that the layperson can understand it. My more "step-by-step" style content is found on my [Medium](https://medium.com/@yapjiahong2003).

2. Health - I run and manage an Instagram account on Health and Wellness.

3. Variety - As a university student, I am more than capable of doing research on a new topic and writing content about it.
