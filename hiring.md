I am open to hire for comissions or freelance! Here is what I can do.

# Software development

I have experience in developing:
1. Bots (Discord bot)
2. An API (experience with Rust, Python, NodeJS)
3. Mobile applications
4. Desktop applications

For a full list of projects take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/AlphabetsAlphabets). My CV is also available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tAa9nSyL5Mog6oP0rPCetuMlOljoX3QX/view?usp=sharing).

# Copywriter

I can write on a variety of content. Such as:
1. Technology - As someone who maintains a tech blog, I will always do my best to convey technical information so that the layperson can understand it. This blog is meant for more experienced techies. My more guided content can be found in my [Medium](https://medium.com/@yapjiahong2003) or [Hashnode](alphabetsalphabets.hashnode.dev)

2. Health - I run and manage an Instagram account on Health and Wellness.

3. Variety - As a university student, I am more than capable of doing research on a new topic and writing content about it.
