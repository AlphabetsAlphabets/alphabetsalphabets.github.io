I'm computer science student (Graduating ~Aug 2025). I like technology, writing it, and writing about it. This is my blog where I share tips, and the like. I do have an actual blog which discusses the latest in tech, or at least things that are interesting to me and I hope is interesting to you. I am also available for hire take a look at [services](/services).

Would you like to discuss a post of mine? Go ahead! Email is at the bottom of the page :)
